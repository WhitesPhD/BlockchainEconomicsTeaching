***ECOM215 Blockchain Economics and Innovation in Financial Markets

I am posting here some of the material I cover for my course on Blockchain Economics and Innovation in Financial Markets at the School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London. Please note that this module is designed for postgraduate students with no previous knowledge of Blockchain technology, engineering, or programming languages. 

The material covers:
1. Foundations of Blockchain Technology
2. A Primer on Blockchain Economics
3. Smart contracts and Decentralised Applications (DApps) [coming next]

I may occasionally post articles or Python codes.
