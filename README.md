**ECOM215 Blockchain Economics and Innovation in Financial Markets
**

I am posting some of the material I cover for my Blockchain Economics and Innovation in Financial Markets course at the School of Economics and Finance, Queen Mary University of London. Please note that this module is designed for postgraduate students without previous knowledge of Blockchain technology, engineering, or programming languages. 

The material covers:
1. Foundations of Blockchain Technology
2. A Primer on Blockchain Economics
3. Smart contracts and Decentralised Applications (DApps) [coming next]

I may occasionally post articles or Python codes.
